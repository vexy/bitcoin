# Vincoin ~ The [Vincoin](https://github.com/vincoin/vincoin) Experiment
Back in 2019, at the dawn of "_cryptocurrencies_" and other faulty Vincoin implementations, the idea of **Vincoin** emerged.  

It is imagined to expand Bitcoin basic functionalities and allow huge group(s) of people get better understanding, access and usage of this technology. 

Most importantly, every user is guaranteed equal amount of coins upon registration, **free of charge**.


## Key differences
_Vincoin_ is mostly based on Bitcoin features (regular fork), but has major key differences:
- total amount of coins in circulation
- initial amout of coins every user is guaranteed with
- restricted, non-public access (zKP based)
- **0%** mining fees
- improved hashing algos
- general (economical) narrative

## General narrative
Sole purpose of _Vincoin_ is to be distributed to a group of people, allowing their economical potential to grow. Having equal amount of coins, straight at the start, provides greater opportunities and expanded decision set for it's participants. Eventually, _Vincoin_ coin "value" may be compared with other currencies, allowing for price duality for every good/product _Vincoin_ network processes.

### No mining fees
_Vincoin_ follows good old Torrent, DC++, Napster, SETI@Home and TOR (or any similar distributed network) philosophies.  
Maintaining the network nodes **isn't** something that should be "_incentivized_" by earning transaction fees but rather by understanding the greater goal of providing advanced coin exchange system for it's users.  
Vincoin coders are born in past century so they grew up under different network mentality...  

### Restricted access (zKP based)
Providing that every user is given equal amount of coins upon accessing the system, _Vincoin_ network introduces additional layer of security **NOT allowing public access** to the system. Users will be providing "known proof" of their origin (eg. Passport number, Social ID) which will be validated using _zero knowledge proofs_ validation schemes. Thus requiring "external" validator solely for this purpose.

### Improved hashing algos
_Vincoin_ utilizes modern hashing algos, mainly _[argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)_ family and _[Zero Knowledge Proofs (zKP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)_ validation schemes.
